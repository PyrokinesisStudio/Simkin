Introduction to Simkin for C++</H1>
<hr>
Simkin is a simple interpreted language that can be placed within data files, including XML or within databases.
<p>
<P>It can used to enable users to customize a C++-based application using scripts.
<p>The language is interpreted by the C++ classes provided in the package.
<p>The classes provide direct support for embedding the scripts within XML documents or within "TreeNode" files.
<P>Simkin was written by&nbsp; <A HREF="mailto:sdw@larts.co.uk">Simon
Whiteside</A> . You can visit its web page at&nbsp; <A HREF="http://www.simkin.co.uk">http://www.simkin.co.uk</A>
<P>Simkin was originally developed in 1996 using C++ in order to implement an interactive adventure
game. A multimedia game engine supplied primitive functions which were
called by scripts which controlled the logic of the game.
<P>Since then, Simkin has also been used in the well-known music notation program&nbsp;
<A HREF="http://www.sibelius.com">Sibelius</A>&nbsp; to supply the "Manuscript"
plug-in system. Users can write scripts to perform useful transformations
to the music they have written.
<p>In 2000, Simkin was re-implemented to work with Java and XML.
<p>
Simkin for C++ is covered by the GNU <a href="../Simkin/LGPL.txt">LGPL<a> licence.
