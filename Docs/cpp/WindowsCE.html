Simkin on Windows CE</H1>
<hr>
<p>
Since version 2.14 Simkin has been available for Windows CE 3.0. 
<p>
The porting effort was generously funded by HP Labs in Bristol.
<p>
There are various issues with the support for C++ on Windows CE 3.0:
<p>
<ol>
<li>C++ Exceptions are not supported</li>
<li>C++ Streams are not supported</li>
<li>Unicode characters are used</li>
</ol>
<p>
Simkin contains preprocessor directives to provide a special version of the library to address these issues:
<ol>
<li><b>EXCEPTIONS_DEFINED</b><br>if undefined, code using C++ exceptions is disabled. 
<br>An <a href="ce/api/classskExecutableContext.html">skExecutableContext</a> object is passed to method calls which uses an <a href="ce/api/classskScriptError.html">skScriptError</a> object to catch any errors that would normally be thrown as a C++ exception.<p>
</li>
<li><b>STREAMS_ENABLED</b><br>if undefined this disables all the code within Simkin which relies on C++ streams<p>
</li>
<li><b>UNICODE_STRINGS</b><br>if defined, this enables code which uses unicode wide character strings rather than standard 8-bit characters
</ol>
In order to run the library examples in Windows CE, you will need to copy the Simkin script files (either TreeNode or XML) onto the device, and save them in <b>Unicode</b> format.
<p>
The Windows CE version works with either TreeNode format files, or with a special version of the <b>Expat</b> XML parser, which can be downloaded <a href="http://www.simkin.co.uk/download/Expat-1.95.5-ce-sym.zip">from the Simkin site</a>. We are not aware of a version of the <b>Xerces</b> XML parser which works on Windows CE.
<p>
Project files for Embedded C++ version 3.0 have been provided.
<p>
You may also be able to use the <b>Microsoft MSXML</b> classes in Windows CE.
