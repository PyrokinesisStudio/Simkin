Using Simkin with your C++ application</H1>
<hr>
Simkin for C++ is distributed in source code format. It has been written in C++
using templates.
<P>Typically you build Simkin into a library to link with your application.
<p>We supply some example project files which build a static library or dynamic library (Windows only).
<ul>
<LI>
Makefile - for use with Linux and gcc</LI>
<LI>
Simkin.dsw - workspace for use with Visual C++ on Windows </LI>
</UL>
in all cases, you will have to add the correct include and libraries for your Xerces-C or Expat distribution.
<p>
Simkin source files and classes are all prefixed with "sk" to prevent name
clashes with classes in your own application.
<p>
Simkin is composed of a core interpreter, plus support for XML and our own "TreeNode" files.
<p>
Simkin supports two XML libraries:
<ul>
<li>Expat - this is used in conjunction with Simkin's own XML Document Object Model classes. You need to obtain Expat separately from <a href="http://expat.sourceforge.net" target="_blank">http://expat.sourceforge.net</a>
<li>Xerces-C from the Apache Foundation. This library is also *not* included in the Simkin distribution, it can be obtained from <a href="http://xml.apache.org/xerces-c">http://xml.apache.org/xerces-c</a><br><small>Note for Visual C++ for Windows: you need to build your applications with Code Generation set to "Multithreaded DLL" when using the Xerces-c library</small></li>
</ul>
Each file format has its own associated classes:<p>
<table border=1>
<tr><th>File Format</th><th>Classes</th></tr>
<tr><td>TreeNode</td><td><a href="api/class_skTreeNodeObject.html">skTreeNodeObject</a></td></tr>
<tr><td>Expat XML</td><td><a href="api/class_skElementObject.html">skElementObject</a> and <a href="api/class_skElementExecutable.html">skElementExecutable</a></td></tr>
<tr><td>Xerces XML</td><td><a href="api/class_skXMLElementObject.html">skXMLElementObject</a> and <a href="api/class_skXMLExecutable.html">skXMLExecutable</a></td></tr>
