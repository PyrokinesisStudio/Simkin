<H1>
Using Simkin with your C++ application</H1>
<hr>
Simkin for C++ is distributed in source code format. It has been written in C++
using templates.
<P>Typically you build Simkin into a library to link with your application.
<p>We supply some example project files which build a static library.
<ul>
<LI>
Makefile - for use with Linux and gcc</LI>
<LI>
Simkin.mcp - for use with CodeWarrior on MacOS (this does not include the XML files)</LI>
<LI>
Simkin.dsw - workspace for use with Visual C++ on Windows </LI>
</UL>
in all cases, you will have to add the correct include and libraries for your Xerces-C distribution.
<p>
Simkin source files and classes are all prefixed with "sk" to prevent name
clashes with classes in your own application.
<p>
The classes within Simkin that interact with XML use the Xerces-C library from the Apache Foundation. 
<p>This library is *not* included in the Simkin distribution, it can be obtained from <a href="http://xml.apache.org/xerces-c">http://xml.apache.org/xerces-c</a>
<p>The classes (<a href="api/skXMLElementObject.html">skXMLElementObject</a> and <a href="api/skXMLExecutable.html">skXMLExecutable</a>) can be reimplemented to use a different XML library, without affecting the rest of the interpreter, which does not itself require any XML libraries.
<p><small>Notes:
<ul>
<li>Visual C++ for Windows: you need to build your applications with Code Generation set to "Multithreaded DLL" when using the Xerces-c library</li>
</ul>
