TreeNode Format</H1>
<hr>
Simkin script can be stored within any convenient mechanism.
<p>The distrubution includes classes that show how it can be stored within XML files, or within a format called "TreeNode".
<p>The TreeNode format is hierarchical textual format which echoes that used in many applications.
<p>The advantages of using the TreeNode format over XML are:
<ul>
<li>A 3rd party XML library (such as Xerces for C++ or jaxp for Java) is not required - all TreeNode classes are included in the distribution</li>
<li>Simkin script is slightly simpler in TreeNode files</li>
<li>The TreeNode classes seem to operate faster than XML ones, and the memory footprint is smaller</li>
</ul>
The TreeNode format is a recursive definition. Each TreeNode item is composed of:
<ol>
<li>a label - this is alphanumeric, but may also include the following characters:
<ul type="disc">
<li>: - colon</li>
<li>- - minus sign</li>
<li>. - dot</li>
<li>/ - forward slash</li>
<li>\ - back slash</li>
<li>_ - underscore</li>
<li>~ - tilde</li>
</ul>
This makes it possible to store path names without spaces as a label.<p>Simkin methods use the label to store the method name.
<p>
</li>
<li>data - this is arbitrary text, including spaces and line endings, within the delimeters "[" and "]". You use "\[" and "\]" to quote these delimeters within the text. Whitespace in the text is preserved.<p>
Simkin methods are stored within the data for an item.<p></li>
<li>children - this is a list of descendents of the item, which are themselves items. The list is delimeted by "{" and "}"</li>
</ol>
Each element is optional.
<p>A TreeNode "file" is an item with no label or data, but a list of items.
<p>Here are some examples:
<p>A TreeNode file with a single item, with the label "field" but no data or children:
<pre>
{
 field
}
</pre>
<p>A TreeNode file with a single item, with the label "field", data "value" and a single child with the label "child":
<pre>
{
 field [value]
 {
  child
 }
}
</pre>
<p>A TreeNode file with a field "field" and a Simkin method "method":
<pre>
{
 field [value]
 method [(){
 }]
}
</pre>
