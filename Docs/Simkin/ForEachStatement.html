Simkin for each Statement</H1>
<hr>
<p>
This statement allows you to iterate over a collection, with an optional qualifier.
<p>
The statement has 2 main sections: 
<ol>
<li>the <code>for each</code> section specifies what to enumerate over, and which variable to bind each item to<p></li>
<li>this is followed by a block of statements to be executed for each item</li>
</ol>
Here is an example of unqualified iteration:
<pre>
// looks at each item in the collection, 
// the variable "item" will receive each item in the iteration
for each item in collection {
 trace(item.name);
}
</pre>
In this example, a qualifier is added:
<pre>
// looks at each "simple" item in the collection, 
// the variable "simple_item" will receive each item in the iteration
for each simple simple_item in collection {
 trace(item.name);
}
</pre>
The underlying code interprets the qualifier in whatever way is appropriate to it.
