Writing Simkin Scripts</H1>
<hr>
Simkin script can be placed within an XML document, a <a href="../java/api/simkin/TreeNode.html">TreeNode (Java)</a> or <a href="../cpp/api/classskTreeNode.html">skTreeNode (C++)</a> file or from some other source, such as a database.
<p>Using Simkin, your script can call other methods within the document, or within other C++ or Java objects. It can also manipulate the data elements of the document.
<p>XML or TreeNode documents can contain a mixture of data elements and script elements. 
<p>Slightly different syntax is used in the two different formats. 
<p>Here's a method in an XML document:
<pre>
&lt;function name="method" params="arg"&gt;
self.foo();
&lt;/function&gt;
</pre>
Here's a method in a TreeNode file:
<pre>
method [(arg){
self.foo();
}]
</pre>
In XML the parameters are defined within the <b>params</b> attribute, in TreeNode, they are declared within "(" ")"
<p>Here's a more detailed example in XML:
<pre>
&lt;myobject&gt;
&lt;Field1&gt;Value&lt;/Field1&gt;
&lt;function name="Method" params="arg"&gt;
trace("Hello World"); 
trace("Field1=" # Field1);
trace(arg);
&lt;/function&gt;
&lt;/myobject&gt;
</pre>
In this example the XML file contains a data element called "Field1" and a function called "Method". 
<p>The data field can be any standard XML field. The function element has two attributes:
<ul>
<li><b>name</b> - the name of the method
<li><b>params</b> - a list of parameters to the method (separated by commas)
</ul>
The text within the element contains Simkin script as a series of statements separated by ";".
<p>In the example the method calls another method called "trace". This is actually a method within the underlying C++ or Java application.
<p>The example also retrieves the "value" of the field "Field1". This is the text that exists between the opening and closing of the "Field1" tag. The "#" operator adds two strings together.
<p>You can also access attributes and sub-tags of elements:
<pre>
&lt;myobject&gt;
&lt;Field1 attribute="value"&gt;
&lt;SubField1&gt;
MyValue
&lt;/SubField1&gt;
&lt;/Field1&gt;
&lt;function name="Method"&gt;
trace("Field1:attribute=" # Field1:attribute);
trace("Field1.SubField1=" # Field1.SubField1);
&lt;/function&gt;
&lt;/myobject&gt;
</pre>
<br>The Simkin <a href=Syntax.html>Syntax</a> is a very simple, like JavaScript, and contains statements such as "if" and "while", and operators for doing mathematics and string manipulation.
<br><br>Simkin script can call into methods implemented either in C++ or Java or in Simkin script itself.
<br><br>Please see this example script <a href="Example.xml.txt">Example.xml</a>
<br>Here is the equivalent in TreeNode: <a href="Example.s.txt">Example.s</a>
