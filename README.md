# Simkin

Simkin is a high-level lightweight embeddable scripting language which works with Java™ or C++ and XML.

Simkin enables you to hand over control of part or all of your application to your users.

The language has been designed to be easy enough for non-programmers to use, and easy for you to supply a simple API for them to write to.

It could revolutionize the way your system gets developed - you provide the mechanism, others can decide the policy.

Simkin for Java™ and C++ is a free Open-Source product.

## Simkin for C++

Simkin is a simple interpreted language that can be placed within data files, including XML or within databases.

It can be used to enable users to customize a C++-based application using scripts.

The language is interpreted by the C++ classes provided in the package.

The classes provide direct support for embedding the scripts within XML documents or within "TreeNode" files.

Simkin was originally developed in 1996 using C++ in order to implement an interactive adventure game. A multimedia game engine supplied primitive functions which were called by scripts which controlled the logic of the game.

Since then, Simkin has also been used in the well-known music notation program  Sibelius  to supply the "Manuscript" plug-in system. Users can write scripts to perform useful transformations to the music they have written.

In 2000, Simkin was re-implemented to work with Java and XML.

Simkin for C++ is covered by the GNU LGPL licence.
